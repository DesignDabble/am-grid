# am-Grid

This project is:

### Made with flexbox
- No weird floats
- Vertical alignment is trivial
- Horizontal alignment is trivial

### Trying to find a solution to
* Using `border-box`, flexbox, and gutters on the grid (IE has issues)
* Experimenting with [attribute module](https://amcss.github.io/)
